# So what's been happening?

I've spent the past 6 months of my life researching things I've always wanted to understand and learn. After a while, I started realizing I needed to get my own site back online and get this information out there, not only to help myself retain the information, but also to get community input and start constructive conversations. I've been reading and toying with things from designing custom hardware-busses to talk to things like Intel PICs, to reading up on the Netflix OSS, to building gaming addons with LUA script.

# What's the overall goal of this site?

I want to be able to share my experiences and insight into all topics technology, development, and IT related. I work with a lot of different technology stacks, and I encounter and solve lots of issues across them, learning valable information in one domain and having it complement resolutions in others. I'm sure I'm not the only one to make a lot of these connections, but I find they're ofter under-documented, not documented at all, or have been explained in a completely biased and unfair way.

# Un-biased and straight-up

If you're wondering if this site is going to be biased toward certain vendors and products, then I can assure you right now this will not be the case. Call me dirty all you want, but I work on Windows, Linux, and iOS platforms across the board. I work with Java, .NET, JS, front-end, back-end, middleware, networking, hardware, and everything in-between. Technologies are built to solve particular problems and they're not a one-size-fits-all type of beast...if that were the case, there wouldn't be a need for multiple OSes, architectures, libraries, vendor solutions, etc.
