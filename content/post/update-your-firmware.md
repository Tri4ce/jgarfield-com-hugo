# Overview

These days we have so much hardware running proportionally just as much firmware. With so many drive-by exploits and security vulnerabilities existing these days, you need to make sure you keep up-to-date with your firmware as-such!

# Setup a schedule

I know, another damn item and alert to add to your digital calendar. You won't feel the same way though if you have to go explain to your manager that your company got hacked because you didn't simply click a few buttons and upload a new firmware image to a device on the network.

# No Excuses

## "We can't afford down-time" or "We don't have an environment to test in"

Well then you better be able to afford redundant hardware to allow down-time and/or provision a test environment. Are your clients going to accept these excuses when they're taking you to court over a data-breach due to negligence?
