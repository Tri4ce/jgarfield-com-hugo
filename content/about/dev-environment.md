# Development Environment

I'm sometimes asked what tools I have installed on my machine to develop with.

IDEs

* Visual Studio Code - I've recently switched to this IDE exclusively due to excellent language support and light-weight footprint compared to some larger IDEs.
* Eclipse - Sometimes I just want a really good FREE Java IDE
* IntelliJ IDEA - My license has run out at this point, but I absolutely adore this IDE. Very developer-focused and has all the features you need
* Visual Studio (FULL) - I have actually sunset this as an IDE I prefer to use on a daily basis. They've still yet to create a 64-bit version and the footprint and speed of this thing are just outrageous these days.

Languages / Frameworks

* python2.7
* python3
* nodejs
* npm
* pip
* hugo
* 

Hypervisors

* Hyper-V
* KVM/QEMU
* If I don't have Hyper-V installed locally, chances are I'm using VirtualBox

Utilities

* Notepad++
* 7-Zip
* ngrok
